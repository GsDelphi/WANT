# WANT - A Pascal-Friendly Build Tool

WANT is a Delphi-friendly build tool. See the file:

  [doc_old/index.html](doc_old/index.html)

for more information about WANT.


## EXECUTING WANT

After building or using the binary distribution there's a copy of want.exe
under the "bin" directory.


## BUILDING AND TESTING WANT

Please use the make\bootstrap.bat script to build WANT for the first time.
For a successful build brcc32 and dcc32 must be in a PATH.

After that, you can place a copy of bin\want.exe to a different directory, 
and use that copy to continue building WANT.
